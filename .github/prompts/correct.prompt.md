description: 'Refine English writing while preserving the author’s tone and intent'
---

For each text:
- Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
- Improve sentence flow and clarity when needed, but keep the original meaning and personal style.
- Do not add filler phrases, buzzwords, or unnatural expressions.
- Do not use `—` (em dashes); use standard punctuation like commas or parentheses instead.
- Avoid rewriting in a way that changes the author’s tone or personality.
- Keep the text sounding natural and human, as if written by a French writer with strong English skills.
