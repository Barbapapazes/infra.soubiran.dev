Hey! I'm **Estéban Soubiran**, from [soubiran.dev](https://soubiran.dev).

The website you're on is dedicated to documenting the ecosystem I build and maintain. It's like a personal wiki but open to everyone.

Since the beginning of my web journey in 2018, I've always wanted to read concrete, actionable content about everything that goes on behind the scenes of a website. Unfortunately, I never found such content, an end-to-end resource that would cover everything. I sometimes found corporate articles about infrastructure, but that's far too much for personal projects.

This wiki is my way to fill that gap. Through this wiki, I'll share everything about my infrastructure, the tools I use, the links between them, the deployment process, the platforms I rely on, and more. The documents are highly technical, this isn't meant for beginners, and they cover a wide range of topics, from technical choices to architectural decisions. It's also a way for me to keep track of my infrastructure, empty my brain, and have a reference for future me.

Before reading, there are three things you absolutely need to keep in mind:

- **It's mine**: This wiki documents my own infrastructure, the tools I use, and the choices I've made. You can take inspiration from it, but I won't migrate to another tool just because you tell me to. I'm open to thoughtful suggestions.
- **It's a wiki**: This is a living document that can change over time. I will update it as my infrastructure evolves. But it's not a tutorial or a step-by-step guide (_it's planned; stay tuned_). You won't find detailed instructions on how to set up each component.
- **It's English only**: I won't translate the wiki into other languages. It's a lot of work I already do for my personal blog; due to the technical nature and the constant updates of this wiki, I won't do it here.

I hope you'll find some useful information in this wiki.

Apart from this wiki, I also share content about web development, my open-source journey, and my speaking adventures on my [personal blog](https://soubiran.dev/posts).
